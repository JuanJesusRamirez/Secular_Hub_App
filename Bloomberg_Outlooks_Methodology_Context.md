## Methodological Framework

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source Collection** | Sampling from views and research shared with media or publicly accessible online. Multi-asset and macro teams preferred for broad market overview. Maximum 15 calls per institution. |
| **Selection Criteria** | Key views selected at Bloomberg's discretion. Exclusions apply for: unavailable research, outdated content, late-year events not incorporated. Content edited for style, clarity, and length. |
| **Thematic Categorization** | Manual sorting by editorial relevance into thematic buckets (e.g., AI, macro drivers, risks). Remaining calls organized by standard asset class categories (equities, rates, FX, commodities, alternatives). |
| **Call Ranking** | Within each category, calls ordered by apparent level of conviction as judged by Bloomberg News. Where conviction levels are similar, alphabetical ordering by institution name applies. |
| **Base Case Identification** | Base cases identified by Bloomberg editorial team based on editorial judgment. |

## Key Characteristics

- **Qualitative Aggregation:** This is journalism-driven synthesis, not quantitative modeling. No weighting by historical accuracy or AUM.

- **Editorial Discretion:** Inclusion, presentation, conviction ranking, and base case identification are entirely at Bloomberg News' discretion.

- **Marketing Origin:** Source content originated as marketing material with standard industry disclaimers.

- **Non-Exhaustive:** The list is explicitly not comprehensive; some institutions may not appear because their research was unavailable, or Bloomberg judged the contents to be out-of-date or otherwise unsuitable.

## Notes for AI Processing

When analyzing or referencing this compilation:

1. Treat conviction rankings as editorial interpretation, not quantitative scores
2. Recognize that institutions may hold multiple views across departments; displayed views may not represent full institutional positioning
3. Thematic buckets reflect editorial judgment of relevance, not a standardized taxonomy
4. Base cases represent Bloomberg's identification of central scenarios, not necessarily the most probable outcomes
5. Late-year market moves or events may not be reflected in source outlooks published earlier in the prior year
